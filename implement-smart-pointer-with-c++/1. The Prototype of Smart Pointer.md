## 2. Theory

In c/c++ programing, bugs can easily happen in memory management. C/c++ memory management strictly demand coders to return the applied memory resources while programming, and to make sure no modules are using the memory while returning the memory resources.

It's such a tricky problem: 

First, it's always possible for human to forget to do what's relied on them.

Second, even the implementer actually finish what he or she has to do while implementing some module, nobody can guarantee the maintainer in this module can have such a good memory.

Third, a memory resource can be used by multiple modules when a project has too many modules in a complicated relationship. So it will be a tough problem to figure out when to release the memory resources safely under this circumstance.

According to these reasons, many big project based on C++ would implement a `class` named `smart pointer`, for example, the lightweight pointer class `sp` in the android project and the smart pointer `auto_ptr` in C++STL.

Firstly, the `smart pointer` is a `pointer`, so it can point to the memory resource. Next, being different from other pointers, it's smart, which means 1. it can automatically release the memory for you, 2. it knows the safe time to release the memory.

The implementation of `smart pointer` in C++ is mainly based on two technical concepts.

1. The `destructor`. It's a function invoked when the object is destroyed. For the object based on stacks, it would automatically destroyed itself if the object leaves its action scope.
2. Reference count technique. It maintains the the reference number used to trace resources(like memory)  in a `counter`. When the resource is referred to, plus one on the `counter value`. When the resource stops to be referred to, minus one on the `counter value`.
3. Reload the `operator`.

The general theory of implementing the `smart pointer` is to check the reference count of the reference object. If the reference count is 0, then release the memory of the object.

In the experiment, we will learn the theory in detail.

## 3. Smart Pointer Class

#### 3.1 Define the smart pointer class

First, we express `pointer` as a c++ class, so we need to define a class first:

```c++
// Headfile:smartpionter.h
// Define the smart pointer class
class SmartPointer {
public:
    // .......
    ~SmartPointer(); // From the theory mentioned above, we know we need a destructor
private:
    void *mPointer; // It points to the actual corresponding resource object of the smart pointer
};
```

Check out how we create a origin pointer.

```c++
// Create a pointer that points to nowhere
char *punknown ;
// Create an empty pointer
char *pnull = NULL;
// Create a string pointer
const char *pstr = "Hello world!";
// Create a pointer that points to an actual class
SomeClass *pclass = new SomeClass();
// Create a pointer from a same class
SomeClass *pclassother = pclass;
```

So the `smart pointer` class should be created in the same way.

```c++
//  Create a smart pointer that points to nowhere
SmartPointer spunknown;
// Create an empty smart pointer
SmartPointer spnull = NULL;
// Create a string smart pointer
SmartPointer spstr = "Hello world!";
// Create a smart pointer from a same class
SmartPointer spclass = new SomeClass();
```

#### 3.2 Create the Constructor

According to the how we create a pointer before, the `smart pointer` class  should have the `constructor `below:

1. A `constructor` by default that creates a  `pointer` that points to nowhere;
2. A `constructor` that can be assigned a parameter in any type of pointer, and it can create  an actual memory resource or NULL `smart pointer`;

So the smart pointer class should be like this now:

```c++
// Headfile:smartpionter.h
// Define the smart pointer class
class SmartPointer {
public:
    // The Constructor
    SmartPointer() ;        // A constructor by default               
    SmartPointer(void *p) ;     // it can point to any kind 
    // The destructor
    ~SmartPointer(); // From the theory mentioned above, we know we need a destructor
private:
    void *mPointer; // It points to the actual corresponding memory resource of the smart pointer
};
```

There is a problem in the implementation above, the smart pointer class can't show the type of the object that it points to, which means, the smart pointer doesn't have a type. Representing the type of the object the pointer points to, the type of the pointer is an important concept. For example, `char`, a string pointer, means the type of the object that the pointer points to is string. `Someclass *` shows the type of the object that the pointer points to is a `Someclass` class. But in our resent implementation, when we create a pointer, we transfer all the pointers transported into `SmartPointer`，into `void *` type pointer. As a result, the resource information that `SmartPointer` points to will be lost.

#### 3.3 Define Class Template

The way to solve the problem is to define `SmartPointer` as a class template, and use module parameter to assign the type of the object that the pointer points to.

```c++
// Headfile:smartpionter.h
// Define the smart pointer class
template <typename T>  // Define the smart pointer class as a class template
class SmartPointer {
public:
    // The consctuctor
    SmartPointer():mPointer(NULL) {}      // The constructor by default              
    SmartPointer(T *p):mPointer(p) {}     // Receive the pointer paramter in the assigned type
    // The descructor
    ~SmartPointer(); 
private:
    T *mPointer; // Points to the memory resource that the smart pointer actually corresponds to.
};
```

So we'll use the `smart pointer` this way:

```c++
// Create a pointer that points to nowhere
SmartPointer<char> spunknown;
// Create an empty smart pointer
SmartPointer<char> spnull = NULL;
// Create a smart pointer that points to an actual class
SmartPointer<SomeClass> spclass = new SomeClass;
// Create a string smart pointer
SmartPointer<const char> spstr = "Hello world!";
```

We've introduced a benefit of smart pointer in the theory of it: it can release the memory for us, by implement the release of memory in the constructor of smart pointer. As a result, when the smart pointer class is destroyed(stack object will be destroyed while leaving its action scope), the memory resource it points to will be destroyed automatically.

```c++
// Headfile:smartpionter.h
template <typename T> 
class SmartPointer {
public:
//...
    // The constructor
    ~SmartPointer() { // Implement the automatical destroying mechanism of the memory resource
        if (mPointer) delete mPointer;
    } 
//...
};
```

#### 3.4 Implement Smart Pointer version 1

Experiment code (smartpointer.h)：

```c++
/* 
* file name : smartpointer.h
* desp : smart pointer v1
*/
#ifndef __SMARTPOINTER_H__
#define __SMARTPOINTER_H__

template <typename T>  // Define the smart pointer class as class template
class SmartPointer {
public:
    // The constructor by default 
    SmartPointer():mPointer(NULL) {std::cout <<"create unknown smart pointer."<< std::endl;}    
    // Receive the consructor of different pointer type
    SmartPointer(T *p):mPointer(p) {std::cout <<"create smart pointer at "<<static_cast<const void*>(p)<<std::endl;}     
    // The destructor
    ~SmartPointer(){
        std::cout << "release smart pointer at "<<static_cast<const void*>(mPointer)<<std::endl;
        // Implement the automatical destroying mechanism of the memory resource
        if (mPointer) delete mPointer;
    }
private:
    T *mPointer; // Points to the memory resource that the smart pointer actually corresponds to.Then define the pointer type of the internal resource, according to the automatical derivation rule of parameters.
};
#endif // __SMARTPOINTER_H__
```

#### 3.5 Test 

Next, let's verify the current version 1 by an example:

Test code (sptestcase1.cpp)：

```c++
/* 
* file name : sptestcase1.cpp
* desp : Test code of smart pointer case1: Creating and destroying the smart pointer
*/

#include <iostream>
#include "smartpointer.h"
class SomeClass{
public:
    SomeClass(){std::cout << "SomeClass default constructor !"<<std::endl;}
};

void testcase1()
{
    // Create a pointer that points to nowhere
    SmartPointer<char> spunknown;
    // Create an empty smart pointer
    SmartPointer<char> spnull = NULL;
    // Create a smart pointer that points to an actual class
    SmartPointer<SomeClass> spclass = new SomeClass;
    // Create a string smart pointer
    SmartPointer<const char> spstr = "Hello world!";  
}

int main(void)
{
    testcase1();
    return 0;
}
```

Compile and run：

```
$ g++ -o sptestcase1 sptestcase1.cpp
$ ./sptestcase1
```

Analyze the result：

## 4. Summary

The result above is generally what we expect the smart pointer to be. However, when the program runs until the end, there's a bug when the smart pointer releases the pointer that points to "Hello world!".
Pay attention here, we should accept the limitation of smart pointer as we enjoy its convenience: **The smart pointer can't pointer to a memory resource that can't be released by delete.**
