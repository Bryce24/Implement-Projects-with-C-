## 2. Steps

#### 2.1 Wild Pointer

In the implementation of version 2, by implementing `copy constructor` and `assignment operator`, the smart pointer can point to the same memory resource now.

But there's also a problem in version 2.

Assume we have multiple smart pointers pointing to the same memory resource, as the image shows below:

![此处输入图片的描述](https://doc.shiyanlou.com/document-uid298389labid2505timestamp1484131812900.png/wm)

When one of the pointer is destroyed, it would automatically release the memory it points to. As a result, the other smart pointers still being used and referring to the memory resource will become wild pointers.

A classic solution to the problem above, is to use reference count technique. Reference count technique means every object should maintain all the reference count number of it. When a new reference points to the object, the reference counter will increase progressively. And when a reference is removed, the reference counter will decrease progressively. When the reference count is 0, the object will release the occupied resource.

As the picture shows below, after bringing the reference count technique, when multiple smart pointer point to the same memory resource, the reference count number will increase.

When one of the multiple smart resource that share the same memory resource is destroyed, the reference count will decrease at the same time. But the memory resource won't be destroyed, because the other pointers are still using it:

When the last smart pointer pointing to the memory resource is destroyed, the reference count will be 0, and the memory resource will be released:

While implementing reference count technique, the main question is "who should store the reference count". It's not possible to let the smart pointer do it. Because maybe when a smart pointer is destroyed, the resource object it points to is still available. So the reference count should be stored in the referred resource object. In a word, one resource object should be correspond to one reference count. When its reference count is 0, the resource object can be destroyed.

#### 2.2 How to Bring in Reference Count Technique

Take `SomeClass` for example, let's check out how to bring in reference count technique:

```cpp
class SomeClass{
public:
    /*The constructor, initialize the reference count value as 0*/ 
    SomeClass():mCount(0){std::cout << "SomeClass default constructor !"<<std::endl;}
    ~SomeClass(){std::cout << "SomeClass deconstructor !"<<std::endl;}
    /*When smart pointer points to the class, plus 1 on reference count*/
    void incRefCount(){   
        mCount++;   
    }   
    /*When a smart poiner pointing to this class is destroyed, minus 1 on reference count value and return*/
    int decRefCount(){   
        return --mCount;
    }   
    
private:
    int mCount;
};
```

So the smart point should be implemented this way:

```cpp
//Headfile：smartpointer.h
template <typename T>  // Define the smart operator as class template
class SmartPointer {
public:
//......  
    // Receive constuctor of different object types
    SmartPointer(T *p):mPointer(p) {
         /*When the smart pointer points to class T, plus one on reference count*/ 
        if (mPointer) mPointer->incRefCount();
    }    
    // The destructor
    ~SmartPointer(){
        // Implement the automatical destroying mechanism of the memory resource
        if (mPointer && mPointer->decRefCount()==0) delete mPointer;
    }
    // Copy constructor 
    SmartPointer(const SmartPointer &other):mPointer(other.mPointer) {
       // Plus one on the reference count
       if(mPointer) mPointer->incRefCount();
    }     
   // Assignment operator            
   SmartPointer &operator = (const SmartPointer &other) {
       T *temp(other.mPointer);
       // The new poiting object, plus one on reference count
       if (temp) temp->incRefCount();
       // The former poiting object, minus one on reference count. IF the reference count is 0 afterwards, destroy the former resource object.
       if (mPointer && mPointer->decRefCount()==0) delete mPointer;
       // The smart pointer points to the new resource object
       mPointer = temp;  
       return *this;
   } 
//......  
private:
    T *mPointer; // Points to the memory resource that the smart pointer actually corresponds to.Then define the pointer type of the internal resource, according to the automatical derivation rule of parameters.
};
```

There're mainly 4 points to implement when bringing in smart pointer with reference count:

1. The constructor that receives different types of objects

   It's quite simple to implement, just plus one on the reference count.

2. The destructor

   Doesn't have to delete. Just minus one on the reference count first. When reference count is 0, delete.

3. Copy constructor

   Implement copy constructor, make the underlying pointers share the same memory resource , and plus one on the reference count.

4. Assignment operator

   It's a bit more complicated to implement assignment. We should plus one on the reference count of the new pointing object, minus one on the reference count of the former pointing object, and destroy the former pointing object if needed. Pay attention here, the implementation of our new assignment doesn't need `if (this == &other) return *this;` statement to deal with self assignment. You can analyze the reason why by yourself.

#### 2.3 Implement Smart Pointer Version 3

By analyzing the implementation of smart pointer version 3, we can see that, in order to use reference count technique, the smart pointer can't point to any resource object like the origin pointer. The smart pointer can only point to resource class implemented with `incRefCount` and `decRefCount`.

Generally, according to the object-oriented programming, we will manage the content of reference count and make it into a base class in the abstract. Then ,any resource class that expects to be referred by smart pointer can just inherit the class.

```cpp
// Headfile：smartpointer.h
/*Reference count base class*/
class RefBase   
{   
    public:   
        RefBase() : mCount(0){ }   
        void incRefCount(){   
            mCount++;   
        }   
        int decRefCount(){   
            return --mCount;
        }   
        //! DEBUGGING ONLY: Get current ref count.   
        int getRefCount(){   
            return mCount;   
        }     
        virtual ~RefBase(){};
    private:   
        int mCount;   
};   

/*SomeClass class inherited from reference count base class*/
class SomeClass: public RefBase{
public:
    SomeClass(){std::cout << "SomeClass default constructor !"<<std::endl;}
    ~SomeClass(){std::cout << "SomeClass deconstructor !"<<std::endl;}
};

/*OtherClass class inherited from reference count base class*/
class OtherClass: public RefBase{
public:
    OtherClass(){std::cout << "OtherClass default constructor !"<<std::endl;}
    ~OtherClass(){std::cout << "OtherClass deconstructor !"<<std::endl;}
};
```

Put `RefBase` in, with the smart pointer in the headfile `smartpointer.h`, and we get the smart pointer version 3 with reference count technique

```cpp
/* 
* file name : smartpointer.h
* desp : smart pointer v3
*/
#ifndef __SMARTPOINTER_H__
#define __SMARTPOINTER_H__

template <typename T>  // Define the smart operator as class template.
class SmartPointer {
public:
    // The construnctor by default.
    SmartPointer():mPointer(NULL) {std::cout <<"Create null smart pointer."<< std::endl;}    
    // Receive constuctor of different object types.
    SmartPointer(T *p):mPointer(p) {
        std::cout <<"Create smart pointer at "<<static_cast<const void*>(p)<<std::endl;
        /*When the smart pointer points to class T, plus one on reference count*/
        if (mPointer) mPointer->incRefCount();
    }     
    // The destructor
    ~SmartPointer(){
        std::cout << "Release smart pointer at "<<static_cast<const void*>(mPointer)<<std::endl;
        // Implement the automatical destroying mechanism of the memory resource.
        if (mPointer && mPointer->decRefCount()==0) delete mPointer;
    }
    // Copy constructor.
    SmartPointer(const SmartPointer &other):mPointer(other.mPointer) {
        std::cout <<"Copy smart pointer at "<<static_cast<const void*>(other.mPointer)<<std::endl;
       // Plus one on the reference count.
       if(mPointer) mPointer->incRefCount();
    }     
   // Assignment operator.          
   SmartPointer &operator = (const SmartPointer &other) {
       T *temp(other.mPointer);
       // Plus one on the reference count of the new pointing object.
       if (temp) temp->incRefCount();plus one on the reference count of the new pointing object, minus one on the reference count of the former pointing object, and destroy the former pointing object if needed
       // Minus one on the reference count of the former pointing object. (destroy the former object if it becomes 0)
       if (mPointer && mPointer->decRefCount()==0) delete mPointer;
       // Smart pointer points to the new resource object.
       mPointer = temp;  
       return *this;
   } 
  
private:
    T *mPointer; // Points to the memory resource that the smart pointer actually corresponds to.Then define the pointer type of the internal resource, according to the automatical derivation rule of parameters.
};

/*Reference count base class*/
class RefBase   
{   
    public:   
        RefBase() : mCount(0){ }   
        void incRefCount(){   
            mCount++;   
        }   
        int decRefCount(){   
            return --mCount;
        }   
        // Debug the interface, return the current reference count of the object.
        int getRefCount(){   
            return mCount;   
        }     
        virtual ~RefBase(){ }
    private:   
        int mCount;   
};   
#endif // __SMARTPOINTER_H__

## 3. Summary

In this lab, by bringing in reference count, we finally make our smart pointer act smartly: it can automatically destroy the resource object it should destroy, and can do it just fine. But it's not perfect enough for a pointer. We use pointer to replace the resource object, but need to visit the content of it at the end. How can a smart pointer suit this need? Check out the next experiment.
